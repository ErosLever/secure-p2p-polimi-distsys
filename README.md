Secure Peer to Peer File Sharing - Distributed Systems Course Project

This project is the result of an assignment for the 2012 edition of the 
Distributed Systems course at Politecnico di Milano.
For this project we were required to produce a working P2P architecture 
which allows clients to exchange files in an authenticated and confidential 
way that also guarantees integrity. 
It is a two-level architecture with simple nodes and super nodes, entirely 
written in pure Java with a Swing interface, intentionally (as requested) 
without using any third party library nor pre-built included libraries 
like SSL (so using java.security & javax.crypto packages).
